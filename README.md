# Chests

Just more modern vanilla chests.

## Inspiration

Some time ago I asked the question, why do chests still have the old, ugly textures? \
So I decided to create a new look, but still matching the vanilla style.

And finally your storage room will be beautiful. \
See [galery](https://github.com/Konsyliarz42/chests/tree/master/galery) for chest renders.
